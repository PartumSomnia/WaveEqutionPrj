# Wave Equation

## Goals and Context

 * Basic concept of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) and the initial-boundary value problem (IVBP)
 * Finite differencing methods for derivative approximation
 * Method-of-line for time-domain PDEs with Runge-Kutta timesteps
 * Numerical implementation of methods to solve multi-D PDEs
 * Concepts of numerical stability and convergence

## Methods

The students will numerically solve the IBVP with the wave equation in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions (one time and one and two spatial dimension). 
The project has different sequential steps

 * Wave equation and reduction to first order system
 * Characteristic analysis and well-posedness
 * Finite differencing approximation of derivatives and convergence
 * Runge-Kutta time integrators
 * Solution of IBVP with the 1+1 wave equation and periodic boundaries using the method of lines
 * Stability and convergence
 * IBVP with open boundaries and Sommerfeld boundary conditions
 * Wave equation with a potential: the Regge-Wheeler equation, scattering of gravitational waves off a black hole and quais-normal modes
 * More spatial dimensions: the 2+1 wave equation

Students can code in their preferred language, although Python is strongly recommended (open sources, simple and optimal for visualizations.)

## Prerequisites

 * Basic knowledge of partial differential equations
