# WaveEqutionPrj

This project contains the materail for the grad. student research 
project realted to numerically solving the wave equations at 
FSU Jena, where I was teaching in 2019-2020. 

The project contains theoretical part where the details 
about the numerical implementation of the second order 
partial differential equation, the wave equation, are 
explained and theoretical questions are asked. 

Then, the numerical implementation is shown and proper 
tests are dsicussed. 

The final outcome of the project is to gain a deep 
understanding of how numerically solve PDEs, test 
the implementation, investigate different boundary 
conditions and create a self-consistent report or a 
poster.
